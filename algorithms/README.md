 - Search Algorithms
   - Robin-Karp Algorithm (string-searching algorithm, that uses rolling hash function(internally use sliding window technique to reduce the time complexity) to find an exact match of a pattern string in a text. )
 - ~~Sorting Algorithms~~
 - Bit Manipulation Algorithms
 - Divide & Conqure Algorithms
 - Greedy Algorithm
   - ~~Prim's Algorithm (finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph)~~
   - Kruskal's Algorithm (finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph. If the graph is connected, it finds a minimum spanning tree)
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm (finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph)
 - Recursive and Backtracking Algorithms
    - ~~BFS and DFS (Graph Traversal Algorithm) (Recursive implementation)~~
 - Dynamic Programming
   - Knapsack problem
   - KMP Algorithm (string-searching algorithm searches for occurrences of a "word)
