 - Complexity Analysis
 - Searching (Linear and Binary)
 - ~~Sorting Algorithms~~
 - Basics of Graphs
 - BFS and DFS (Graph Traversal Algorithm)
 - Robin-Karp Algorithm (string-searching algorithm, that uses hashing to find an exact match of a pattern string in a text. )
 - Dijkstra's Algorithm (finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph)


 - Greedy Algorithm
   - Prim's Algorithm (finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph)
   - Kruskal's Algorithm (finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph. If the graph is connected, it finds a minimum spanning tree)
 - Dynamic Programming
   - KMP Algorithm (string-searching algorithm searches for occurrences of a "word)
